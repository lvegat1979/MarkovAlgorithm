# MarkovAlgorithm
This is a implementation for Markov Algorithm resolving a encrypted chain.  


This Algorithm  was created using Visual Studio and C# 2017 x Luis Vega

I created a couple of libraries to centralice the logic.

In the client side I'm using .Net Core and Angular 4.0. 

The results are displayed like table, with angular components consuming WebApi.

The start project is WebAppMarkov this must be as an initial project

I implemented this to find any work in any direction

Please give the necesary acces to folder ..\MarkovAlgorithm\WebAppMarkov\Files Because I use this files from file system
